# Matching an Email Regex Tutorial

<!-- Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text) -->

Regex expressions otherwise known as regular expressions are a pattern of characters used to search through information in the form of text. When applied in coding, specific regex paremeters allow a user to find a specific pattern of text within a larger text chunk, to find and replace specific data or strings of characters and validate information by comparing the input to the regex expression used. This is possible because each component present in the pattern has a unique role. This role will be described more in our specific example. 


## Summary

<!-- Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary. -->

The regex I will be going over is a regex used to verify an inputted email as being valid. Email verification is generally a standard for any application that requires user autentication. Although the contents of a email string differ depending on the user, certain requirements exist for an email to work. In this assignment I will be explaining the use of each componenet within this regex and how it all works together.
